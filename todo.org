* TODO Yadav and Michalak (2013) Kronecker products
* TODO Compare performance for different input chunk-sizes
  Doing everything in memory is only slightly slower, so there should
  be some optimum where caching is still good but I'm not spending so
  long building a huge dask graph and iterating through it.
* TODO Investigate nonzero increments for spatial structure
  R packages geostatsp, geoR, fields, and RandomFields would probably
  be useful
* TODO Check whether storing spectrum as a numpy array makes HomogeneousIsotropicCorrelations faster
  It may be re-calculating the weights on each trip through, which
  would be really slow.
